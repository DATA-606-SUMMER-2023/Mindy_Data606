THE INSTRUMENT PASSED THE ELECTRICAL CONTINUITY TEST. THE INSTRUMENT WAS PLACED AND DRIVEN ON AN IN-HOUSE SYSTEM. THE INSTRUMENT MOVED INTUITIVELY IN ALL DIRECTIONS. THE GRIPS OPENED AND CLOSED PROPERLY. THE INSTRUMENT DELIVERED ENERGY ON SEVERAL ATTEMPTS. THE COMPLAINT REGARDING UNKNOWN ISSUE WAS CONFIRMED BY FAILURE ANALYSIS, WHICH INDICATES THAT THE DEVICE DID CONTRIBUTE TO THE CUSTOMER REPORTED ISSUE. THE PROBABLE ROOT CAUSE OF DAMAGED CONDUCTOR WIRE INSULATION AND/OR THERMAL DAMAGE IS ATTRIBUTED TO CARBONIZED TISSUE ON THE GRIPS OF THIS BIPOLAR INSTRUMENT CREATING A CONDUCTIVE PATH DURING USE. THERMAL DAMAGE CAN ALSO RESULT DUE TO INADVERTENT ENERGY APPLICATION FROM A MONOPOLAR INSTRUMENT. THIS COMPLAINT IS CONSIDERED A REPORTABLE EVENT DUE TO THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSION: THE INSTRUMENT HAD CONDUCTOR WIRE DAMAGE. THERMAL DAMAGE AT OR NEAR A CONDUCTOR WIRE BREAKAGE IS EVIDENCE OF ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE AT A LOCATION OTHER THAN INTENDED. WHILE THERE WAS NO HARM OR INJURY TO THE PATIENT, THE REPORTED FAILURE MODE COULD LIKELY CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO AN ADVERSE EVENT IF IT WERE TO RECUR. "

THE VALVE APPEARED TO BE FULLY EXPANDED AND ALL VOLUME WAS DELIVERED TO THE BALLOON AT THE TIME OF IMPLANT. THE FIRST VALVE WAS SEATED AT THE LEVEL OF THE SINOTUBULAR JUNCTION (STJ) AND CORONARY PERFUSION WAS ADEQUATE.  A SECOND 29MM S3 WAS DELIVERED THROUGH THE FIRST VALVE AND SUCCESSFULLY IMPLANTED AT THE LEVEL OF THE ANNULUS AND CORONARY PERFUSION WAS STILL INTACT.  THE PATIENT REMAINED STABLE THROUGHOUT THE PROCEDURE AND LEFT THE ROOM IN STABLE CONDITION. Manufacturer Narrative: PER THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU), VALVE MALPOSITION REQUIRING INTERVENTION IS A KNOWN POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSCATHETER VALVE REPLACEMENT (THV) PROCEDURE. THERE ARE MULTIPLE PATIENT AND PROCEDURAL FACTORS THAT ALONE OR IN COMBINATION CAN CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO MALPOSITION, INCLUDING IMPROPER POSITIONING BEFORE DEPLOYMENT, POOR IMAGE INTENSIFIER ANGLE, POOR COAXIAL ALIGNMENT OF THE VALVE AND DELIVERY SYSTEM, MINIMALLY OR BULKY/SEVERELY CALCIFIED LEAFLETS, PRESERVED EJECTION FRACTION, SIGNIFICANT LANDING ZONE CALCIFICATION, LOSS OF PACING CAPTURE, RAPID DEPLOYMENT, THE RELEASE OF STORED TENSION DURING DEPLOYMENT, INACCURATE MEASUREMENT OF THE LANDING ZONE, A LANDING ZONE WITH AN ELLIPTICAL SHAPE, AND VALVE UNDER OR OVERSIZING. ADDITIONAL RISK FACTORS IN THE AORTIC POSITION INCLUDE A NARROW SINOTUBULAR JUNCTION AND SEVERE SEPTAL HYPERTROPHY. THE IFU CAUTIONS THAT INCORRECT SIZING OF THE VALVE MAY LEAD TO PARAVALVULAR LEAK, MIGRATION, OR EMBOLIZATION. THE THV TRAINING MANUALS INSTRUCT THE OPERATOR ON PROPER POSITIONING AND DEPLOYMENT OF THE VALVE, INCLUDING ALL PROCEDURAL AND ANATOMICAL CONSIDERATIONS. PHYSICIANS ARE EXTENSIVELY TRAINED BY EDWARDS BEFORE THEY ARE QUALIFIED TO USE THE SAPIEN THV (ALL MODELS). TRAINING INCLUDES PATIENT SCREENING, DEVICE PREPARATION, APPROACH, DEPLOYMENT, IMAGING, PROCEDURE-SPECIFIC TRAINING MANUALS, AND PROCTORED PROCEDURES. THE CORRECT ALIGNMENT AND POSITIONING OF THE DEVICE AT THE POINT OF DEPLOYMENT IS EMPHASIZED AS A KEY FACTOR IN THE PLACEMENT AND FIXATION OF THE DEVICE. OPERATORS ARE ALSO INSTRUCTED TO USE FLUOROSCOPY AS THE PRIMARY METHOD OF VISUALIZATION FOR POSITIONING AND DEPLOYMENT. IN PATIENTS WITH HIGH-RISK ANATOMICAL FEATURES FOR MALPOSITION OR EMBOLIZATION, A BALLOON VALVULOPLASTY MAY INDICATE POTENTIAL BALLOON MOVEMENT DURING VALVE DEPLOYMENT. IN THIS CASE, THERE WAS NO ALLEGATION OR INDICATION THAT A PRODUCT MALFUNCTION CONTRIBUTED TO THIS ADVERSE EVENT. INVESTIGATION RESULTS SUGGEST/INDICATE THAT UNKNOWN PATIENT AND/OR PROCEDURAL FACTORS MAY HAVE CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO THIS EVENT. A REVIEW OF EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES RISK MANAGEMENT DOCUMENTATION WAS PERFORMED FOR THIS CASE. THE REPORTED EVENT IS AN ANTICIPATED RISK OF THE TRANSCATHETER HEART VALVE PROCEDURE, ADDITIONAL ASSESSMENT OF THIS ADVERSE EVENT IS NOT REQUIRED AT THIS TIME. THE IFU AND TRAINING MANUALS HAVE BEEN REVIEWED AND NO INADEQUACIES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED WITH REGARDS TO WARNINGS, CONTRAINDICATIONS, AND THE DIRECTIONS/CONDITIONS FOR THE SUCCESSFUL USE OF THE DEVICE. COMPLAINT HISTORIES FOR ALL REPORTED EVENTS ARE REVIEWED AGAINST TRENDING CONTROL LIMITS MONTHLY, AND ANY EXCURSIONS ABOVE THE CONTROL LIMITS ARE ASSESSED AND DOCUMENTED AS PART OF THIS MONTHLY REVIEW.

NEVER PUSH, AUGER, WITHDRAW, OR TORQUE THIS GUIDE WIRE THAT MEETS RESISTANCE. TORQUING OR PUSHING THIS GUIDE WIRE AGAINST RESISTANCE MAY CAUSE DAMAGE AND/OR TIP SEPARATION OF THIS GUIDE WIRE OR DIRECT DAMAGE TO A VESSEL. RESISTANCE MAY BE FELT AND/OR OBSERVED UNDER FLUOROSCOPY BY NOTING ANY BUCKLING OF THE GUIDE WIRE. IF THE PROLAPSE OF THE GUIDE WIRE TIP IS OBSERVED, DO NOT ALLOW THE TIP TO REMAIN IN A PROLAPSED POSITION; OTHERWISE DAMAGE TO THE GUIDE WIRE MAY OCCUR. DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF RESISTANCE UNDER FLUOROSCOPY AND TAKE ANY NECESSARY REMEDIAL ACTION. IF RESISTANCE IS FELT DUE TO SPASM, BENDING OF THE GUIDE WIRE, OR DUE TO TRAP WHILE OPERATING THIS GUIDE WIRE IN THE BLOOD VESSEL OR REMOVING IT, DO NOT TORQUE AND/OR PULL THE GUIDE WIRE ITSELF. STOP THE PROCEDURE. DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF RESISTANCE UNDER FLUOROSCOPY AND TAKE APPROPRIATE REMEDIAL ACTION. IF THE GUIDE WIRE IS MOVED EXCESSIVELY, IT MAY BREAK OR BECOME DAMAGED, WHICH MAY CAUSE BLOOD VESSEL INJURY OR RESULT IN FRAGMENTS BEING LEFT INSIDE THE VESSEL.

THE DETAILS NAKANISHI OBTAINED ARE AS FOLLOWS: THE EVENT OCCURRED ON (B)(6) 2023. THE DENTIST WAS PERFORMING A CROWN REMOVAL PROCEDURE ON TOOTH #7 OF A PATIENT USING THE Z95L HANDPIECE (SERIAL NO. (B)(6)). THE PATIENT WAS NOT UNDER ANESTHESIA. DURING THE PROCEDURE, THE HANDPIECE OVERHEATED AND THE PATIENT RECEIVED A BURN INJURY WITH BLISTERING TO THEIR MOUTH. THE INJURY HAS HEALED NORMALLY WITHOUT ANY NEED FOR ADDITIONAL MEDICAL TREATMENT. Manufacturer Narrative: THE DENTIST REFUSED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE PATIENT'S WEIGHT. UPON RECEIVING THE DEVICE INVOLVED IN THE MDR EVENT, NAKANISHI CONDUCTED A FAILURE ANALYSIS OF THE RETURNED DEVICE, WHICH INCLUDED MEASURING THE OPERATING TEMPERATURE OF THE DEVICE [REPORT NO. (B)(4)]. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW. METHODOLOGY USED: A) NAKANISHI EXAMINED THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORD AND THE REPAIR HISTORY FOR THE SUBJECT Z95L DEVICE [(B)(6)]. THERE WERE NO PROBLEMS OBSERVED DURING MANUFACTURING OR TESTING NOTED IN THE DHR. THERE WERE ALSO NO REPAIR HISTORY RECORDS SINCE THE DEVICE WAS SHIPPED. B) NAKANISHI CONDUCTED TEMPERATURE TESTING OF THE RETURNED DEVICE IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER: B.1) TEMPERATURE SENSORS WERE ATTACHED TO THE EXTERIOR OF THE DEVICE AT VARIOUS TEST POINTS. THIS INCLUDED THE POINT MOST PROXIMAL TO THE PATIENT (TESTING POINT (1)) AND POINTS FURTHER TOWARD THE DISTAL END OF THE DEVICE (TESTING POINTS (2) THROUGH (4)). THE TEST SETUP WAS PREPARED TO TAKE TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENTS AT ALL POINTS SIMULTANEOUSLY, INCLUDING A REFERENCE MEASUREMENT AT AMBIENT ROOM TEMPERATURE. B.2) NAKANISHI ATTACHED A THERMOCOUPLE (SENSOR TO MEASURE TEMPERATURE) TO EACH OF THE TESTING POINTS. NAKANISHI ROTATED THE DEVICE'S MOTOR AT 40,000MIN-1, WHICH IS THE MAXIMUM RPM FOR THE MOTOR THAT DRIVES THE HANDPIECE (200,000MIN-1 FOR THE HANDPIECE), WITH WATER SPRAY, AND MEASURED THE EXOTHERMIC RESPONSE. B.3) NAKANISHI MEASURED THE TEMPERATURE RISE OF THE RETURNED HANDPIECE SET AT 200,000MIN-1 (MOTOR REVOLUTION 40,000MIN-1). NAKANISHI OBSERVED RISES IN TEMPERATURE AT THE TEST POINTS AS SHOWN BELOW; HOWEVER, THE TEMPERATURES WERE NOT HIGH ENOUGH TO CAUSE A BURN INJURY. THE MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE MEASURED IN THE 5-MINUTE TEST WERE AS FOLLOWS: TEST POINT (1): 33.2 DEGREES C, TEST POINT (2): 37.1 DEGREES C, TEST POINT (3): 29.8 DEGREES C, TEST POINT (4): 30.7 DEGREES C. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC FAILURE MODE(S) AND/OR MECHANISM(S) OF THE ASSOCIATED DEVICE COMPONENTS WAS CONDUCTED AS FOLLOWS: A) NAKANISHI DISASSEMBLED THE HANDPIECE AND PERFORMED A VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE INTERNAL PARTS. NAKANISHI OBSERVED THE FOLLOWING: THE CARTRIDGE AND THE GEAR OF THE DRIVE SHAFT WERE SOILED AND ABRADED. THE SHANK OF THE BUR RETURNED TOGETHER WITH THE HANDPIECE WAS ABRADED. B) NAKANISHI TOOK PHOTOGRAPHS OF ALL THE DISASSEMBLED PARTS AND KEPT THEM IN THE INVESTIGATION REPORT NO. (B)(4). CONCLUSIONS REACHED BASED ON THE INVESTIGATION AND ANALYSIS RESULTS: A) NAKANISHI DID NOT IDENTIFY THE EXACT CAUSE OF OVERHEATING OF THE RETURNED DEVICE BECAUSE NAKANISHI WAS NOT ABLE TO REPLICATE THE TEMPERATURE RISE AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT, BUT BASED ON THE FINDINGS IN THE VISUAL INSPECTION, AS WELL AS MANY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE, NAKANISHI CONSIDERS THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE CAUSE OF THE HANDPIECE OVERHEATING WAS ABNORMAL RESISTANCE DURING ROTATION CAUSED BY INGRESS OF FOREIGN MATERIALS (ABRASIVE POWDERS) INTO THE HANDPIECE CARTRIDGE AND/OR RESIDUAL LIQUID (EXCESSIVE LUBRICATING OIL) GENERATING HEAT DURING ROTATION INTO THE HANDPIECE CARTRIDGE. B) A LACK OF MAINTENANCE CAUSED THE ACCUMULATION OF DEBRIS ON THE INTERNAL PARTS AND/OR RESIDUAL EXCESSIVE LIQUID, WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO THE HANDPIECE OVERHEATING. C) IN ORDER TO PREVENT A RECURRENCE OF THE HANDPIECE OVERHEATING, NAKANISHI TOOK THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS: C.1) NAKANISHI REVIEWED THE OPERATION MANUAL AND RECONFIRMED THE CLARITY AND UNDERSTANDABILITY OF THE INSTRUCTIONS. C.2) NAKANISHI REPORTED THE ABOVE EVALUATION RESULTS TO THE DENTIST AND REMINDED THE DENTIST OF THE IMPORTANCE OF MAINTENANCE AND CHECKING OF THE HANDPIECE PRIOR TO USE TO PREVENT OVERHEATING, AS INSTRUCTED IN THE OPERATION MANUAL."

THE PROCEDURE WAS COMPLETED WITH NO REPORTED INJURY. INTUITIVE SURGICAL, INC. (ISI) MADE MULTIPLE FOLLOW-UP ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. HOWEVER, NO FURTHER DETAILS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT. Manufacturer Narrative: BASED ON THE CLAIM AGAINST THE PRODUCT BY THE CUSTOMER NOTING A BROKEN CABLE, AN INVESTIGATION WAS COMPLETED TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THIS REPORTED EVENT. INTUITIVE SURGICAL, INC. (ISI) DID RECEIVE A DA VINCI PRODUCT TO PERFORM FAILURE ANALYSIS. THE FORCE BIPOLAR INSTRUMENT WAS ANALYZED AND FOUND TO HAVE DAMAGE TO THE CONDUCTOR WIRE¿S INSULATION. A VISUAL INSPECTION FOUND THE WIRE NOT EXPOSED. THE INSTRUMENT PASSED THE ELECTRIC CONTINUITY TEST. THE INSTRUMENT WAS PLACED AND DRIVEN ON AN IN-HOUSE SYSTEM. THE INSTRUMENT PASSED THE RECOGNITION AND ENGAGEMENT TESTS. THE INSTRUMENT MOVED INTUITIVELY WITH FULL RANGE OF MOTION IN ALL DIRECTIONS. THE GRIPS OPENED AND CLOSED PROPERLY. THE INSTRUMENT WAS FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND RELEASED ENERGY NORMALLY. THE COMPLAINT REGARDING THE BROKEN CABLE WAS CONFIRMED BY FAILURE ANALYSIS, WHICH INDICATES THAT THE DEVICE DID CONTRIBUTE TO THE CUSTOMER-REPORTED ISSUE. ADDITIONALLY, THE INSTRUMENT WAS FOUND TO HAVE A FRAYED GRIP CABLE AT THE DISTAL END. THE FRAYED CABLE STRANDS STUCK OUT AT THE WRIST. THE PROBABLE ROOT CAUSE OF DAMAGED CONDUCTOR WIRE INSULATION IS ATTRIBUTED TO COMPONENT SUSCEPTIBILITY TO DAMAGE DURING USE OR REPROCESSING. DAMAGE CAN RESULT FROM MECHANICAL IMPACTS, SUCH AS ACCIDENTAL DROPS OF THE INSTRUMENT OR INADVERTENT COLLISIONS WITH OTHER INSTRUMENTS OR HARD SURFACES DURING HANDLING OR USAGE. THE PROBABLE ROOT CAUSE OF CABLE BREAKAGE, WHETHER PARTIAL OR FULL, IS ATTRIBUTED TO A REDUCTION IN THE ULTIMATE STRENGTH OF THE MATERIAL, WHICH MAY BE THE RESULT OF DAMAGE TO THE CABLE THROUGH EXTERNAL COLLISIONS, DURING USE, OR DURING REPROCESSING. THIS COMPLAINT IS CONSIDERED A REPORTABLE EVENT DUE TO THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSION: THE INSTRUMENT HAD CONDUCTOR WIRE DAMAGE. THE DAMAGED/BROKEN CONDUCTOR WIRE HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE AT A LOCATION OTHER THAN INTENDED. WHILE THERE WAS NO HARM OR INJURY TO THE PATIENT, THE REPORTED FAILURE MODE COULD LIKELY CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO AN ADVERSE EVENT IF IT WERE TO RECUR. "

COMPLAINT SYSTEM REVIEW: BASED ON A REVIEW OF THE LAST 2 YEARS OF COMPLAINT DATA, AND AT THE TIME OF THIS INVESTIGATION, NO SYSTEMIC ISSUES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED FOR THIS BATCH NUMBER THAT WOULD HAVE CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED EVENT. BASED ON A REVIEW OF THE DEVICE¿S RISK DOCUMENTATION, THE REPORTED EVENT DID NOT INDICATE THERE WERE ANY POTENTIAL OR NEW MANUFACTURING, DESIGN, QUALITY, OR OTHER SYSTEMIC ISSUES, OR NON-CONFORMANCES. THE COMPLAINT CODE IS MONITORED THROUGH THE TRENDING PROCESS; CORRECTIVE ACTION IS DETERMINED, AS NEEDED, THROUGH THIS PROCESS. INVESTIGATIONS OF HISTORIC COMPLAINT FILES WITH SIMILAR COMPLAINT CATEGORY CODING ARE RECORDED IN THE COMPLAINT HANDLING SYSTEM; WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO PERFORM AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE, THIS INVESTIGATION CANNOT IDENTIFY WITH CERTAINTY ANY POTENTIAL ROOT CAUSES. IFU REVIEW (ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CAN BE FOUND IN THE IFU): WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS. PRECAUTION: DO NOT ADVANCE THE DELIVERY PUSHER WITH EXCESSIVE FORCE. DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF ANY UNUSUAL RESISTANCE, REMOVE THE AZUR SYSTEM, AND CHECK FOR DAMAGE. ADVANCE AND RETRACT THE AZUR SYSTEM SLOWLY AND SMOOTHLY. REMOVE THE ENTIRE AZUR SYSTEM IF EXCESSIVE FRICTION IS NOTED. IF EXCESSIVE FRICTION IS NOTED WITH A SECOND AZUR SYSTEM, CHECK THE MICROCATHETER FOR DAMAGE OR KINKING. DIRECTIONS FOR USE: 21. PUSH THE COIL INTO THE LUMEN OF THE CATHETER. USE CAUTION TO AVOID CATCHING THE COIL ON THE JUNCTION BETWEEN THE INTRODUCER SHEATH AND THE HUB OF THE CATHETER. INITIATE TIMING USING A STOPWATCH OR TIMER AT THE MOMENT THE DEVICE ENTERS THE CATHETER. DETACHMENT MUST OCCUR WITHIN THE SPECIFIED REPOSITION TIME. 22. PUSH THE AZUR SYSTEM THROUGH THE CATHETER UNTIL THE PROXIMAL END OF THE DELIVERY PUSHER MEETS THE PROXIMAL END OF THE INTRODUCER SHEATH. LOOSEN THE RHV. RETRACT THE INTRODUCER SHEATH JUST OUT OF THE RHV. CLOSE THE RHV AROUND THE DELIVERY PUSHER. SLIDE THE INTRODUCER SHEATH COMPLETELY OFF OF THE DELIVERY PUSHER. USE CARE NOT TO KINK THE DELIVERY SYSTEM. TO PREVENT PREMATURE HYDRATION OF THE AZUR SYSTEM, ENSURE THAT THERE IS FLOW FROM THE SALINE FLUSH. 23. DISCARD THE INTRODUCER SHEATH. THE AZUR SYSTEM CANNOT BE RE-SHEATHED AFTER INTRODUCTION INTO THE MICROCATHETER. 25. UNDER FLUOROSCOPIC GUIDANCE, SLOWLY ADVANCE THE COIL OUT THE TIP OF THE CATHETER. CONTINUE TO ADVANCE THE COIL INTO THE LESION UNTIL OPTIMAL DEPLOYMENT IS ACHIEVED. REPOSITION IF NECESSARY. IF THE COIL SIZE IS NOT SUITABLE, REMOVE AND REPLACE WITH ANOTHER DEVICE. IF UNDESIRABLE MOVEMENT OF THE COIL IS OBSERVED UNDER FLUOROSCOPY FOLLOWING PLACEMENT AND PRIOR TO DETACHMENT, REMOVE THE COIL AND REPLACE WITH ANOTHER MORE APPROPRIATELY SIZED COIL. MOVEMENT OF THE COIL MAY INDICATE THAT THE COIL COULD MIGRATE ONCE IT IS DETACHED. DO NOT ROTATE THE DELIVERY PUSHER DURING OR AFTER DELIVERY OF THE COIL INTO THE VASCULATURE. ROTATING THE DELIVERY PUSHER MAY RESULT IN A STRETCHED COIL OR PREMATURE DETACHMENT OF THE COIL FROM THE DELIVERY PUSHER, WHICH COULD RESULT IN COIL MIGRATION. ANGIOGRAPHIC ASSESSMENT SHOULD ALSO BE PERFORMED PRIOR TO DETACHMENT TO ENSURE THAT THE COIL MASS IS NOT PROTRUDING INTO UNDESIRED VASCULATURE."

AT THE TIME THE PATIENT HAD AN UNSTABLE BLOOD PRESSURE SO STAFF QUICKLY RAN TO FIND ADDITIONAL MONITORING. ONCE MONITORING HAD BEEN RECOMMENCED, THE TEAM BEGAN INVESTIGATING WHY THE SCREEN HAD FAILED AND IT APPEARED TO NO LONGER HAVE ANY POWER. AT THIS POINT THEY NOTICED A 'POWER FAILURE' NOTIFICATION ON THE ANESTHETIC MACHINE AND PUSHED TO FIND AN EXTENSION BOX WHICH WAS PLUGGED INTO THE CLOSEST UPS PLUG SOCKET AND CONNECTED THE ANESTHETIC MACHINE TO THIS EXTENSION. MAINS POWER TO THE ANESTHETIC MACHINE AND MONITORING SCREEN WAS SUBSEQUENTLY REGAINED AND MONITORING LEADS REATTACHED. STAFF THEN IDENTIFIED THAT WHOLE PENDANT OF PLUG SOCKETS WAS NO LONGER WORKING, AS THE OPERATING TABLE, BELMONT RAPID INFUSOR AND INFUSION PUMPS ALSO HAD NO POWER. THIS EQUIPMENT WAS MOVED AND PLUGGED INTO AN EXTENSION BOX WHICH WAS PLUGGED INTO A SECOND UPS SOCKET. CONTACTED ESTATES WHO INFORMED THAT THE FUSE SWITCH HAD TRIPPED BUT THE SOCKETS WERE NOW TURNED BACK ON. 20 MINUTES LATER, ONCE AGAIN LOST POWER TO OUR ANESTHETIC MACHINE AND BOTH EXTENSION BOXES ON THE UPS CIRCUIT. AFTER TRANSFERRING THE PATIENT ONTO BACK-UP MONITORING FOR A SECOND TIME, STAFF SUSPECTED THAT THE BELMONT RAPID INFUSOR MAY BE THE CAUSE. THIS EQUIPMENT WAS NO LONGER NEEDED, THEREFORE UNPLUGGED THE MACHINE BEFORE CALLING ESTATES TO TURN THE UPS SOCKETS BACK ON. CASE WAS COMPLETED WITHOUT FURTHER INTERRUPTION AND ONCE THE PATIENT HAD LEFT THEATRE, THE BELMONT RAPID INFUSOR WAS PLUGGED INTO THE PENDANT CIRCUIT INDIVIDUALLY. THE CIRCUITS INSTANTLY TRIPPED AND THEREFORE THIS PIECE OF EQUIPMENT WAS REMOVED FROM THEATRE AND SENT TO MEDICAL PHYSICS FOR ANALYSIS. Manufacturer Narrative: THE INTERNAL COMPLAINT FILE (B)(4) HAS BEEN LOGGED FOR THIS INCIDENT FOR TRACEABILITY. THE RI-2 INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT WAS RETURNED TO BELMONT MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES (UK OFFICE) FOR EVALUATION ON FEBRUARY 22, 2023. THE USER CONFIRMED THAT THERE WAS NO PATIENT INJURY ASSOCAITED WITH THIS INCIDENT. THE USER FACILITY REPORTED THAT: WHILE OPERATING ON AN EMERGENCY POLYTRAUMA PATIENT, THE CLINICAL TEAM NOTICED THAT THE MONITORING SCREEN OF THE ANESTHETIC MACHINE HAD TURNED OFF AND FAILED TO TURN ON AGAIN. AT THE TIME THE PATIENT HAD AN UNSTABLE BLOOD PRESSURE SO STAFF QUICKLY RAN TO FIND ADDITIONAL MONITORING. ONCE MONITORING HAD BEEN RECOMMENCED, THE TEAM BEGAN INVESTIGATING WHY THE SCREEN HAD FAILED AND IT APPEARED TO NO LONGER HAVE ANY POWER. AT THIS POINT THEY NOTICED A 'POWER FAILURE' NOTIFICATION ON THE ANESTHETIC MACHINE AND USHED TO FIND AN EXTENSION BOX WHICH WAS PLUGGED INTO THE CLOSEST UPS PLUG SOCKET AND CONNECTED THE ANESTHETIC MACHINE TO THIS EXTENSION.

EPROM IS NOT SEATED IN THE SOCKET PROPERLY WITH THE OPERATOR ACTION ""IF THE PROBLEM PERSISTS, POWER OFF AND SERVICE MACHINE."" EVALUATION: DURING THE INVESTIGATION IT WAS POSSIBLE TO REPRODUCE THE TRIPPING FAULT. THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE TRIPPING FAULT WAS ISOLATED TO THE TRANSISTORS ON THE POWER DRIVE MODULE. ALTHOUGH THE FAULT COULD BE DETERMINED TO BE THE TRANSISTORS, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DEFINITIVELY DETERMINE WHAT CAUSED THE TRANSISTORS TO TRIP. AFTER FURTHER REVIEW, IT WAS IDENTIFIED THAT Q1 TO Q4 TRANSISTORS ON THE DRIVER A, B BOARDS WERE SHORTED, WHICH CAUSED THE CIRCUIT BREAKER IN THE SYSTEM TO TRIP. THE ROOT CAUSE COULD NOT BE CONFIRMED HOWEVER IT POSSIBLE FROM THE DESCRIPTION OF THE INCIDENT THAT THE DEVICE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN USED AS THE ONLY DEVICE ON A DEDICATED CIRCUIT AS REQUIRED. NO PATIENT WAS INJURED AS A RESULT OF THIS INCIDENT. THE DEVICE SHOULD NOT BE LEFT UNATTENDED DURING USE AND ANY SHUTDOWN OF THE DEVICE IS OBVIOUS TO THE USER, INFUSION OF THE PATIENT CAN BE CONTINUED BY OTHER MEANS. IN THIS CASE THE DEVICE WAS NO LONGER REQUIRED. BELMONT SERVICE DEPARTMENT UPGRADED THE SYSTEM TO THE LATEST SOFTWARE REVISION. TO ENSURE THAT THIS UNIT PERFORMS ACCORDING TO OUR SPECIFICATIONS, IT WAS OPERATED AT ELEVATED TEMPERATURE FOR 48 HOURS. UPON COMPLETION, A FINAL FUNCTIONAL TEST, AN ELECTRICAL SAFETY TEST, AND A FINAL INSPECTION WERE PERFORMED. THE UNIT PASSED ALL TEST SPECIFICATIONS AND INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THIS TYPE OF INCIDENT CLOSELY AND TAKE FURTHER CORRECTIVE AND PREVENTIVE ACTIONS IF REQUIRED."

THERE WAS NO REPORTED PATIENT INJURY. Manufacturer Narrative: THE PHYSICAL DEVICE WAS NOT AVAILABLE FOR EVALUATION TO DETERMINE IF A CONDITION EXISTED THAT WOULD HAVE CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO EVENT. SUPPLEMENTAL IMAGING WAS ALSO UNAVAILABLE FOR REVIEW; WITHOUT IMAGING, THE INVESTIGATION CANNOT VERIFY THE EVENT OCCURRED AS DESCRIBED, NOR COULD THE INVESTIGATION DEFINITIVELY DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE REPORTED EVENT. THIS INFORMATION MAY BE UPDATED IF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED AT A LATER DATE. VISUAL ANALYSIS: A VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE DEVICE CAPTURED IN THIS FILE COULD NOT BE PERFORMED AS A PHYSICAL DEVICE WAS NOT RETURNED FOR EVALUATION, NOR WERE ANY IMAGES OF THE DEVICE PROVIDED IN PLACE OF A DEVICE RETURN. PROCEDURE AND MEDICAL IMAGING WAS NOT PROVIDED FOR THIS INVESTIGATION. BATCH REVIEW: A SEARCH FOR NON-CONFORMANCES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PART/LOT NUMBER COMBINATION DID NOT REVEAL ANY PRODUCTION-RELATED ISSUES RELEVANT TO THE COMPLAINT THAT OCCURRED DURING MANUFACTURING OF THE DEVICE. COMPLAINT SYSTEM REVIEW: THERE ARE NO SIMILAR COMPLAINTS BASED ON THE COMPLAINT CATEGORY REGARDING THIS BATCH NUMBER FROM THE LAST TWO YEARS RECORDED IN THE COMPLAINT SYSTEM AT THE TIME OF THIS INVESTIGATION. BASED ON A REVIEW OF THE DEVICE¿S RISK DOCUMENTATION, THE REPORTED EVENT DID NOT INDICATE THERE WERE ANY POTENTIAL OR NEW MANUFACTURING, DESIGN, QUALITY, OR OTHER SYSTEMIC ISSUES, OR NON-CONFORMANCES. THE COMPLAINT CODE IS MONITORED THROUGH THE TRENDING PROCESS; CORRECTIVE ACTION IS DETERMINED, AS NEEDED, THROUGH THIS PROCESS. INVESTIGATIONS OF HISTORIC COMPLAINT FILES WITH SIMILAR COMPLAINT CATEGORY CODING ARE RECORDED IN THE COMPLAINT HANDLING SYSTEM; WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO PERFORM AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE, THIS INVESTIGATION CANNOT IDENTIFY WITH CERTAINTY ANY POTENTIAL ROOT CAUSES. IFU REVIEW (ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CAN BE FOUND IN THE IFU): POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS; POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: HEMATOMA AT THE SITE OF ENTRY, VESSEL PERFORATION, ANEURYSM RUPTURE, PARENT ARTERY OCCLUSION, INCOMPLETE ANEURYSM FILLING, EMBOLI, HEMORRHAGE, ISCHEMIA, VASOSPASM, COIL MIGRATION OR MISPLACEMENT, PREMATURE OR DIFFICULT COIL DETACHMENT, CLOT FORMATION, REVASCULARIZATION, POST-EMBOLIZATION SYNDROME, AND NEUROLOGICAL DEFICITS INCLUDING STROKE AND POSSIBLY DEATH. CASES OF CHEMICAL ASEPTIC MENINGITIS, EDEMA, HYDROCEPHALUS AND/OR HEADACHES HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF EMBOLIZATION COILS IN THE TREATMENT OF LARGE AND GIANT ANEURYSMS. THE PHYSICIAN SHOULD BE AWARE OF THESE COMPLICATIONS AND INSTRUCT PATIENTS WHEN INDICATED. APPROPRIATE PATIENT MANAGEMENT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. PREPARATION OF THE MCS FOR DELIVERY. REMOVE THE V GRIP DETACHMENT CONTROLLER FROM ITS PROTECTIVE PACKAGING. PULL THE WHITE PULL-TAB FROM THE SIDE OF THE DETACHMENT CONTROLLER. DISCARD THE PULL-TAB AND PLACE THE DETACHMENT CONTROLLER IN THE STERILE FIELD. THE V GRIP DETACHMENT CONTROLLER IS PACKAGED SEPARATELY AS A STERILE DEVICE. DO NOT USE ANY POWER SOURCE OTHER THAN THE MICROVENTION V GRIP DETACHMENT CONTROLLER TO DETACH THE COIL. THE V GRIP DETACHMENT CONTROLLER IS INTENDED TO BE USED ON ONE PATIENT. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO RE-STERILIZE OR OTHERWISE RE-USE THE V GRIP DETACHMENT CONTROLLER. PRIOR TO USING THE DEVICE, REMOVE THE PROXIMAL END OF THE V TRAK DELIVERY PUSHER FROM THE PACKAGING HOOP. USE CARE TO AVOID CONTAMINATING THIS END OF THE DELIVERY PUSHER WITH FOREIGN SUBSTANCES SUCH AS BLOOD OR CONTRAST. FIRMLY INSERT THE PROXIMAL END OF THE DELIVERY PUSHER INTO THE FUNNEL SECTION OF THE V GRIP DETACHMENT CONTROLLER. DO NOT PUSH THE DETACHMENT BUTTON AT THIS TIME. WAIT THREE SECONDS AND OBSERVE THE INDICATOR LIGHT ON THE DETACHMENT CONTROLLER. IF THE GREEN LIGHT DOES NOT APPEAR OR IF A RED LIGHT APPEARS, REPLACE THE DEVICE. IF THE LIGHT TURNS GREEN, THEN TURNS OFF AT ANY TIME DURING THE THREE-SECOND OBSERVATION, REPLACE THE DEVICE. IF THE GREEN LIGHT REMAINS SOLID GREEN FOR THE ENTIRE THREE-SECOND OBSERVATION, CONTINUE USING THE DEVICE. DETACHMENT OF THE MCS COIL: THE V GRIP DETACHMENT CONTROLLER IS PRE-LOADED WITH BATTERY POWER AND WILL ACTIVATE WHEN A MICROVENTION V TRAK DELIVERY PUSHER IS PROPERLY CONNECTED. IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO PUSH THE BUTTON ON THE SIDE OF THE V GRIP DETACHMENT CONTROLLER TO ACTIVATE IT. VERIFY THAT THE RHV IS FIRMLY LOCKED AROUND THE V TRAK DELIVERY PUSHER BEFORE ATTACHING THE V GRIP DETACHMENT CONTROLLER TO ENSURE THAT THE COIL DOES NOT MOVE DURING THE CONNECTION PROCESS. ALTHOUGH THE V-TRAK DELIVERY PUSHER¿S GOLD CONNECTORS ARE DESIGNED TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH BLOOD AND CONTRAST, EVERY EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE TO KEEP THE CONNECTORS FREE OF THESE ITEMS. IF THERE APPEARS TO BE BLOOD OR CONTRAST ON THE CONNECTORS, WIPE THE CONNECTORS WITH STERILE WATER BEFORE CONNECTING THE V GRIP DETACHMENT CONTROLLER. CONNECT THE PROXIMAL END OF THE V TRAK DELIVERY PUSHER TO THE V GRIP DETACHMENT CONTROLLER BY FIRMLY INSERTING THE PROXIMAL END OF THE V TRAK DELIVERY PUSHER INTO THE FUNNEL SECTION OF THE V GRIP DETACHMENT CONTROLLER. WHEN THE V GRIP DETACHMENT CONTROLLER IS PROPERLY CONNECTED TO THE V TRAK DELIVERY PUSHER, A SINGLE AUDIBLE TONE WILL SOUND, AND THE LIGHT WILL TURN GREEN TO SIGNAL THAT IT IS READY TO DETACH THE COIL. IF THE DETACHMENT BUTTON IS NOT PUSHED WITHIN 30 SECONDS, THE SOLID GREEN LIGHT WILL SLOWLY FLASH GREEN. BOTH FLASHING GREEN AND SOLID GREEN LIGHTS INDICATE THAT THE DEVICE IS READY TO DETACH. IF THE GREEN LIGHT DOES NOT APPEAR, CHECK TO ENSURE THAT THE CONNECTION HAS BEEN MADE. IF THE CONNECTION IS CORRECT AND NO GREEN LIGHT APPEARS, REPLACE THE V GRIP DETACHMENT CONTROLLER. VERIFY THE COIL POSITION BEFORE PUSHING THE DETACHMENT BUTTON. PUSH THE DETACHMENT BUTTON. WHEN THE BUTTON IS PUSHED, AN AUDIBLE TONE WILL SOUND, AND THE LIGHT WILL FLASH GREEN. AT THE END OF THE DETACHMENT CYCLE, THREE AUDIBLE TONES WILL SOUND, AND THE LIGHT WILL FLASH YELLOW THREE TIMES. THIS INDICATES THAT THE DETACHMENT CYCLE IS COMPLETE. IF THE COIL DOES NOT DETACH DURING THE DETACHMENT CYCLE, LEAVE THE V GRIP DETACHMENT CONTROLLER ATTACHED TO THE V TRAK DELIVERY PUSHER AND ATTEMPT ANOTHER DETACHMENT CYCLE WHEN THE LIGHT TURNS GREEN. THE LIGHT WILL TURN RED AFTER THE NUMBER OF DETACHMENT CYCLES SPECIFIED ON THE V GRIP LABELING. DO NOT USE THE V GRIP DETACHMENT CONTROLLER IF THE LIGHT IS RED. DISCARD THE V GRIP DETACHMENT CONTROLLER AND REPLACE IT WITH A NEW ONE WHEN THE LIGHT IS RED. VERIFY DETACHMENT OF THE COIL BY FIRST LOOSENING THE RHV VALVE, THEN PULLING BACK SLOWLY ON THE DELIVERY SYSTEM AND VERIFYING THAT THERE IS NO COIL MOVEMENT. IF THE IMPLANT DID NOT DETACH, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO DETACH IT MORE THAN TWO ADDITIONAL TIMES. IF IT DOES NOT DETACH AFTER THE THIRD ATTEMPT, REMOVE THE DELIVERY SYSTEM. AFTER DETACHMENT HAS BEEN CONFIRMED, SLOWLY RETRACT AND REMOVE THE DELIVERY PUSHER. ADVANCING THE V TRAK DELIVERY PUSHER ONCE THE COIL HAS BEEN DETACHED INVOLVES RISK OF ANEURYSM OR VESSEL RUPTURE. DO NOT ADVANCE THE DELIVERY PUSHER ONCE THE COIL HAS BEEN DETACHED. VERIFY THE POSITION OF THE COIL ANGIOGRAPHICALLY THROUGH THE GUIDE CATHETER. PRIOR TO REMOVING THE MICROCATHETER FROM THE TREATMENT SITE, PLACE AN APPROPRIATELY SIZED GUIDEWIRE COMPLETELY THROUGH THE MICROCATHETER LUMEN TO ENSURE THAT NO PART OF THE COIL REMAINS WITHIN THE MICROCATHETER. INVESTIGATION FINDINGS: WITHOUT THE RETURN AND PHYSICAL EVALUATION OF THE DEVICE, THE INVESTIGATION CANNOT DEFINITIVELY DETERMINE IF A CONDITION EXISTED THAT WOULD HAVE CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED EVENT. WITHOUT IMAGING, THE INVESTIGATION CANNOT VERIFY THE EVENT OCCURRED AS DESCRIBED, NOR COULD THE INVESTIGATION DEFINITIVELY DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE REPORTED EVENT."

The MAUDE database houses medical device reports submitted to the FDA by mandatory reporters (manufacturers, importers and device user facilities) and voluntary reporters such as health care professionals, patients and consumers. Each year, the FDA receives several hundred thousand medical device reports (MDRs) of suspected device-associated deaths, serious injuries and malfunctions. The FDA uses MDRs to monitor device performance, detect potential device-related safety issues, and contribute to benefit-risk assessments of these products. The MAUDE database houses MDRs submitted to the FDA by mandatory reporters (manufacturers, importers and device user facilities) and voluntary reporters such as health care professionals, patients and consumers.,,,,,,
Although MDRs are a valuable source of information, this passive surveillance system has limitations, including the potential submission of incomplete, inaccurate, untimely, unverified, or biased data. In addition, the incidence or prevalence of an event cannot be determined from this reporting system alone due to potential under-reporting of events and lack of information about frequency of device use. Because of this, MDRs comprise only one of the FDA's several important postmarket surveillance data sources.,,,,,,
MDR data alone cannot be used to establish rates of events, evaluate a change in event rates over time or compare event rates between devices. The number of reports cannot be interpreted or used in isolation to reach conclusions about the existence, severity, or frequency of problems associated with devices. Confirming whether a device actually caused a specific event can be difficult based solely on information provided in a given report. Establishing a cause-and-effect relationship is especially difficult if circumstances surrounding the event have not been verified or if the device in question has not been directly evaluated.,,,,,,,,,,,
MAUDE data does not represent all known safety information for a reported medical device and should be interpreted in the context of other available information when making device-related or treatment decisions. Variations in trade, product, and company names affect search results. Searches only retrieve records that contain the search term(s) provided by the requester.Submission of a medical device report and the FDA's release of that information is not necessarily an admission that a product, user facility, importer, distributor, manufacturer, or medical personnel caused or contributed to the event. Certain types of report information are protected from public disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).,,,,,,,
If a report contains trade secret or confidential business information," that text is replaced by ""(b)(4)"". If a report contains personnel or medical files information"," that text is replaced by ""(b)(6)"". The designations ""(b)(4)"" and ""(b)(6)"" refer to the exemptions in the FOIA. For example"," ""(b)(4)"" may be found in place of the product's composition and ""(b)(6)"" may be found in place of a patient's age. MAUDE is updated monthly and the search page reflects the date of the most recent update. The FDA seeks to include all reports received prior to the update but the inclusion of some reports may be delayed.",,,,,,,,,,,
Manufacturers and importers must submit reports when they become aware of information that reasonably suggests that one of their marketed devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has malfunctioned and the malfunction of the device or a similar device that they market would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. Manufacturers must send reports of such deaths, serious injuries and malfunctions to the FDA. Importers must send reports of deaths and serious injuries to the FDA and the manufacturer, and reports of malfunctions to the manufacturer.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Device user facilities include hospitals, outpatient diagnostic or treatment facilities, nursing homes and ambulatory surgical facilities. Device user facilities must submit reports when they become aware of information that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury of a patient in their facility. Death reports must be sent to the FDA and the manufacturer, if known. Serious injury reports must be sent to the manufacturer or to the FDA, if the manufacturer is not known.,,,,,,,,,,
